//! # Actor Supervision System
//!
//! This module provides a comprehensive supervision strategy framework for managing actor failures
//! and recovery within the actor system. Supervision strategies define how the system responds
//! to actor startup failures, enabling fault-tolerant operation through configurable retry
//! mechanisms and backoff policies.
//!
//! The supervision system follows the "let it crash" philosophy common in actor systems,
//! where failures are expected and handled through well-defined recovery strategies rather
//! than defensive programming. When an actor fails during startup, the supervisor can either
//! stop the failed actor permanently or attempt to restart it according to a specified
//! retry strategy.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! ## Supervision Strategies
//!
//! - **Stop**: Immediately terminate a failed actor without retry attempts
//! - **Retry**: Attempt to restart failed actors using configurable retry strategies
//!
//! ## Retry Strategies
//!
//! - **NoInterval**: Immediate retry without delay (for fast-failing scenarios)
//! - **FixedInterval**: Retry with consistent delay between attempts
//! - **CustomInterval**: Retry with custom delay sequences (e.g., exponential backoff)
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ## Basic Supervision Setup
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use actor::supervision::{SupervisionStrategy, Strategy, FixedIntervalStrategy};
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! // Stop immediately on failure
//! let stop_strategy = SupervisionStrategy::Stop;
//!
//! // Retry with fixed 1-second intervals, maximum 3 attempts
//! let retry_strategy = SupervisionStrategy::Retry(
//!     Strategy::FixedInterval(
//!         FixedIntervalStrategy::new(3, Duration::from_secs(1))
//!     )
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! ## Custom Backoff Strategies
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use actor::supervision::{Strategy, CustomIntervalStrategy};
//! use std::collections::VecDeque;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! // Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s
//! let backoff_intervals = VecDeque::from([
//!     Duration::from_secs(1),
//!     Duration::from_secs(2),
//!     Duration::from_secs(4),
//!     Duration::from_secs(8),
//! ]);
//!
//! let exponential_strategy = Strategy::CustomIntervalStrategy(
//!     CustomIntervalStrategy::new(backoff_intervals)
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # Error Handling Philosophy
//!
//! The supervision system is designed around several key principles:
//!
//! - **Isolation**: Actor failures are contained and don't cascade to siblings
//! - **Transparency**: Failed actors can be restarted without affecting their public interface
//! - **Configurability**: Different failure scenarios require different recovery strategies
//! - **Observability**: Supervision decisions can be monitored and adjusted based on system behavior
//!

/// Defines the behavior of retry strategies for actor supervision.
///
/// This trait provides the interface for implementing custom retry strategies that determine
/// how many times an actor should be retried and what delays should be applied between
/// retry attempts. Implementors can create sophisticated backoff policies, circuit breaker
/// patterns, or adaptive retry mechanisms based on failure patterns.
///
/// # Implementation Requirements
///
/// - Must be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`) for use across actor system threads
/// - Must be debuggable for monitoring and troubleshooting
/// - Should track internal state to provide varying backoff intervals
///
/// # Design Patterns
///
/// Common retry strategy patterns include:
/// - **Fixed Interval**: Constant delay between retries
/// - **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays to reduce system load under failure
/// - **Linear Backoff**: Gradually increasing delays for predictable recovery
/// - **Jittered Backoff**: Random variation to prevent thundering herd problems
/// - **Adaptive**: Backoff adjustment based on historical success rates
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Implementing a Custom Exponential Backoff Strategy
///
/// ```ignore
/// use actor::supervision::RetryStrategy;

/// Defines the high-level supervision strategy for handling actor startup failures.
///
/// This enum represents the fundamental decision point in the supervision system: whether
/// to give up immediately when an actor fails to start, or to attempt recovery through
/// a retry mechanism. The choice between strategies depends on the nature of the application,
/// the criticality of the failing actor, and the expected failure patterns.
///
/// # Strategy Selection Guidelines
///
/// ## Use `Stop` when:
/// - Actor failures indicate permanent configuration or code issues
/// - System resources are constrained and retries would be wasteful
/// - Fast failure detection is more important than fault tolerance
/// - The actor is non-critical and its absence won't impact system operation
/// - Manual intervention is required to fix the underlying issue
///
/// ## Use `Retry` when:
/// - Failures are likely transient (network issues, resource contention)
/// - The actor provides critical system functionality
/// - External dependencies may be temporarily unavailable
/// - System load balancing benefits from automatic recovery
/// - Recovery time is acceptable for the use case
///
/// # Failure Scope
///
/// Currently, supervision strategies apply only to **startup failures**. Runtime failures
/// during message processing follow different error handling patterns within the actor's
/// message handlers. This design separates initialization concerns from operational concerns.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Immediate Termination Strategy
///
/// ```ignore
/// use actor::supervision::SupervisionStrategy;
///
/// // Stop immediately on any startup failure
/// let strategy = SupervisionStrategy::Stop;
/// ```
///
/// ## Retry with Exponential Backoff
///
/// ```ignore
/// use actor::supervision::{SupervisionStrategy, Strategy, FixedIntervalStrategy};
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// // Retry up to 5 times with 2-second intervals
/// let strategy = SupervisionStrategy::Retry(
///     Strategy::FixedInterval(
///         FixedIntervalStrategy::new(5, Duration::from_secs(2))
///     )
/// );
/// ```
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// - **Stop**: Zero overhead, immediate failure detection
/// - **Retry**: Overhead proportional to retry attempts and backoff durations
/// - Choose retry strategies that balance fault tolerance with system responsiveness

/// # Available Strategies
///
/// - **NoInterval**: Immediate retries without delay, suitable for fast-failing scenarios

///
/// # Strategy Selection
///
/// Choose retry strategies based on failure characteristics and system requirements:
///
/// ## NoInterval Strategy
/// - **Use for**: Resource initialization failures, lock contention, race conditions
/// - **Avoid for**: Network failures, external service dependencies
/// - **Trade-offs**: Fast recovery vs. potential system overload
///
/// ## FixedInterval Strategy
/// - **Use for**: Service dependencies with predictable recovery times
/// - **Avoid for**: Cascading failures, thundering herd scenarios
/// - **Trade-offs**: Predictable timing vs. lack of adaptability
///
/// ## CustomInterval Strategy
/// - **Use for**: Complex failure patterns, exponential backoff, jittered delays
/// - **Avoid for**: Simple scenarios where fixed intervals suffice

///
/// # Characteristics
///
/// - **Predictable timing**: Each retry occurs at exactly the same interval
/// - **Simple configuration**: Only requires retry count and delay duration
/// - **Consistent load**: Generates predictable load patterns on the system
/// - **No adaptation**: Doesn't adjust based on failure patterns or success rates
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// ## Ideal Scenarios
/// - **Service dependencies**: Waiting for external services with known restart times
/// - **Resource cleanup**: Allowing time for resource cleanup between attempts
/// - **Rate limiting**: Respecting API rate limits with consistent spacing
/// - **Batch processing**: Regular retry intervals for batch job failures
///
/// ## Consider Alternatives When
/// - **Cascading failures**: Fixed intervals can create thundering herd problems
/// - **Variable recovery**: Some failures need more/less time than others
/// - **High contention**: Multiple actors retrying simultaneously
/// - **Exponential failure**: Failures that get progressively worse
///
/// # Performance Trade-offs
///
/// **Advantages:**
/// - Predictable resource usage patterns
/// - Simple to reason about and configure
/// - Consistent system load distribution
/// - No complex backoff calculations
///
/// **Disadvantages:**

/// - May retry too quickly for slow-recovering failures

/// ## Decreasing Intervals
/// ```ignore
/// // Start with longer delays, decrease over time
/// let decreasing = CustomIntervalStrategy::new(VecDeque::from([
///     Duration::from_secs(10),  // First retry: wait longer
///     Duration::from_secs(5),   // Second retry: medium wait

///     Duration::from_secs(1),
/// ]));
/// ```
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// - **Memory usage**: O(n) where n is the number of retry attempts
/// - **Time complexity**: O(1) for each backoff calculation
/// - **Flexibility**: Complete control over retry timing patterns
/// - **Predictability**: Exact behavior can be pre-calculated
///
/// # Design Patterns
///
/// ## Circuit Breaker Pattern
/// Implement increasing delays to give failing systems time to recover:
/// ```ignore
/// let circuit_breaker = CustomIntervalStrategy::new(VecDeque::from([
///     Duration::from_secs(1),    // Quick first retry
///     Duration::from_secs(5),    // Give it some time
///     Duration::from_secs(30),   // Longer pause
///     Duration::from_secs(300),  // Much longer pause
/// ]));
/// ```
///
/// ## Adaptive Strategy
/// Use external metrics to determine appropriate delays:
/// ```ignore
/// fn create_adaptive_strategy(system_load: f64) -> CustomIntervalStrategy {
///     let base_delay = Duration::from_millis((100.0 * system_load) as u64);
///     CustomIntervalStrategy::new(VecDeque::from([
///         base_delay,
///         base_delay * 2,
///         base_delay * 4,
///     ]))
/// }
/// ```

/// - Consuming durations from the queue in order for each backoff request

///
/// The `pop_front()` behavior is key to this strategy's functionality - it ensures
